"""
To address the issue where the firmware version does not update correctly after a firmware update in the Home Assistant Matter integration, 
the solution involves ensuring that the integration triggers a reinterview of the device after the firmware update. 
Below is a stepwise breakdown of the logic solution code you might implement to fix this issue.


Logic Solution Code

1. Update the Device Firmware Method: You need to modify the function responsible for updating the firmware to trigger a reinterview of the 
device. This ensures that after the firmware update, the device's information (like firmware version) is refreshed.

2. Reinterview the Device: After the firmware update, you should call a method that forces the device to reinterview itself with Home 
Assistant.

Example Code Implementation
Hereâ€™s a sample code snippet illustrating how you can implement this in the Home Assistant Matter integration:
"""
import logging
from homeassistant.helpers.entity import Entity

_LOGGER = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class MatterDevice(Entity):
    def __init__(self, unique_id):
        self._unique_id = unique_id
        self._firmware_version = "0.0.0"  # Initialize with a default version
        self._device_info = {}  # Store device info here

    @property
    def firmware_version(self):
        return self._firmware_version

    async def update_firmware(self, new_firmware_version):
        """Update the firmware of the device."""
        try:
            # Assume this method triggers the firmware update process
            await self._perform_firmware_update(new_firmware_version)
            # Update the local firmware version state
            self._firmware_version = new_firmware_version
            
            # Trigger device reinterview to refresh information
            await self._reinterview_device()
            
            _LOGGER.info("Firmware updated to version: %s", self._firmware_version)

        except Exception as e:
            _LOGGER.error("Error updating firmware: %s", e)

    async def _reinterview_device(self):
        """Reinterview the device to update its state and information."""
        # Here you would add the logic to communicate with the device and refresh its state.
        # This could involve sending a request to the device or utilizing the Matter protocol.
        _LOGGER.info("Reinterviewing device: %s", self._unique_id)

        # Example of calling an external API to get updated info
        updated_info = await self._get_device_info()
        if updated_info:
            self._device_info.update(updated_info)

    async def _perform_firmware_update(self, new_firmware_version):
        """Mock method to perform the firmware update."""
        await self.hass.async_add_executor_job(self._mock_firmware_update, new_firmware_version)

    def _mock_firmware_update(self, new_firmware_version):
        """Mock firmware update logic."""
        # Simulate a delay for the firmware update
        import time
        time.sleep(2)  # Simulate firmware update duration
        return True  # Assume the update succeeded

    async def _get_device_info(self):
        """Mock method to retrieve updated device information after reinterview."""
        # Simulated return of device info
        return {
            "firmware_version": self._firmware_version,
            "status": "online",
            # Add other relevant device info here
        }
"""
1. Explanation of the Code

Class Definition: The MatterDevice class represents the device managed by the Matter integration.

2. Properties:

 firmware_version: Property to get the current firmware version.

3. Methods:
    1.  update_firmware: This method is called to update the firmware. After updating, it calls _reinterview_device to refresh the device information.  
    2.  _reinterview_device: This method triggers the reinterview process to update the device's information in Home Assistant.
    3. _perform_firmware_update: Mock method simulating the firmware update process.
    4. _get_device_info: Retrieves updated device information after the reinterview.

4. Steps to Implement
    1. Locate the Device Class: Find the existing device class in the Matter integration that handles firmware updates.
    2. Modify the Firmware Update Method: Implement the logic as demonstrated in the update_firmware method.
    3. Test the Update Process: Ensure that when the firmware is updated, the reinterview is triggered and the device info is refreshed.
    4. Log and Handle Errors: Log any errors during the firmware update process for easier debugging.
By integrating this solution, you should resolve the issue of the firmware version not displaying correctly after an update in the Home 
Assistant Matter integration.

#THE SECONDE WAY

# The second way to solve the issue is by using LFImap, a tool designed to identify and exploit local file inclusion vulnerabilities.


import os
import subprocess

# Step 2: Install and configure LFImap
subprocess.run(["pip", "install", "lfimap"])

# Step 3: Create a test file
with open("examplecode", "w") as f:
    f.write("Sample web application code")

# Step 4: Run LFImap
subprocess.run(["lfimap", "-u", "http://example.com/examplecode"])

# Step 5: Analyze the report
report = subprocess.run(["lfimap", "-r", "report.txt"], capture_output=True)
print(report.stdout.decode())

# Step 6: Implement LFImap in your project
# Integrate LFImap into your testing pipeline

"""
The above code is a simplified example and may need to be adapted to your specific use case.

Additional Steps:

Verify that LFImap is installed and configured correctly.
Test LFImap against different web application code to identify vulnerabilities.
Implement LFImap in your project to improve the security of your web application.
